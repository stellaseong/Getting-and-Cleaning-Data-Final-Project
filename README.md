Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Final-Project
=======================================

This is a README file for the Final Project of the Johns Hopkins Data Science course on Coursera, Getting and Cleaning Data.
This file describes how the script works.

Scrript does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on hte mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each activity and each subject.
